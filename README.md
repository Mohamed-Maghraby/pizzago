## Project Motivation?
- This project was built to practice and demonstrate key front-end development concepts using modern tools like React.js, Redux Toolkit, React Router, and Tailwind CSS.

- The goal was to simulate a real-world ordering system based on clear business requirements with state management in consideration, API integration and routing.

- The project helped me to learn how to:

    - Translate business needs into functional features

    - Manage shared global state efficiently

    - Handle real-time UI updates and dynamic forms

    - Build scalable components using utility-first CSS (Tailwind)
